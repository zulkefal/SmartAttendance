## Overview

Traditional attendance systems rely on manual entry or paper-based methods, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and environmentally unsustainable.
**Smart Attendance** leverages computer vision to automatically detect and recognize studentsâ€™ faces using a connected camera, ensuring a fast, accurate, and paperless solution.

##  How It Works

1. **Capture Image:** The system uses a camera feed to capture student images in real-time.
2. **Face Detection:** EMGU CV identifies faces using Haar Cascade classifiers.
3. **Face Recognition:** Recognized faces are matched with stored profiles.
4. **Atten dance Logging:** Attendance records are saved to SQL Server with timestamps.
5. **Reporting:** Faculty can view or export attendance reports as needed.
